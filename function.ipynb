    "##**Functio:n**\n",
    "\n",
    " - A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    " - It can be called independently and is not tied to any specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Functions can take arguments and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(greet(\"Anshuli\"))  \n",
    "     \n",
    "     # Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n",
    "\n",
    "##**Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - A method is essentially a function that is defined inside a class and is tied to an object (instance of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    " - It is called on an object, and the object itself is passed as the first argument (self).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Methods typically operate on the data (attributes) of the object they belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Greeter:\n",
    "    def greet(self, name):\n",

    "    # Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n",
    "\n",
    ">>Key Distinction<<\n",
    "\n",
    " - Functions are standalone and can be called directly.\n",
